1. Getting data ready:	Data can be almost anything but to get started we're going to create a simple straight line
2. Building a model:	Here we'll create a model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a loss function, optimizer and build a training loop.
3. Fitting the model to data (training):	We've got data and a model, now let's let the model (try to) find patterns in the (training) data.
4. Making predictions and evaluating a model (inference):	Our model's found patterns in the data, let's compare its findings to the actual (testing) data.
5. Saving and loading a model:	You may want to use your model elsewhere, or come back to it later, here we'll cover that.
6. Putting it all together:	Let's take all of the above and combine it.
